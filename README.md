# Discord Audit Eye

- Given a user, tracks the amount of mutes, moves, and disconnects that a user has done to another user.
- Accomplishes this by parsing the Discord Audit Log, searching for specific action commands

- Allows custom text to be set to allow the user to set any trigger message for the bot to search a user.
